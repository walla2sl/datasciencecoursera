#Code Book
Contains a list of variables, data files, and transformations performed by run_analysis.R

##Variables and associated data transformations
- **working_dir** - stores working directory
- **data_dir** - relative path to the UCI HAR Dataset being analyzed
- **dt_activity_labels** - stores activity label data read into R from activity_labels.txt
- **dt_features** - stores feature data read into R from features.txt
- **dt_X_train** - stores X training data read into R from X_train.txt
- **dt_y_train** - stores y training data read into R from y_train.txt
- **dt_subject_train** - stores subject training data read into R from subject_train.txt
- **dt_X_test** - stores X test data read into R from X_test.txt
- **dt_y_test** - stores y test data read into R from y_test.txt
- **dt_subject_test** - stores subject test data read into R from subject_test.txt
- **dt_X** - the merged result of dt_X_train and dt_X_test; column names are replaced with those found in dt_features; all columns except mean and standard deviation are dropped
- **dt_y** - the merged result of dt_y_train and dt_y_test; activity_key in dt_y is replaced with activity_name from dt_activity_labels
- **dt_subject** - the merged result of dt_subject_train and dt_subject_test
- **dt_merged** - the merged result of dt_subject, dt_X, and dt_y, with descriptive column names. This includes only mean and standard deviation measures broken down by subject_id and activity_name
- **dt_merged_averaged** - the result of taking the average of all measures in dt_merged, broken down by subject_id and activity_name

##Data Files
- **activity_labels.txt** - list of activity ids with associated activity label (or name)
- **features.txt** - list of all feature names
- **X_train.txt** - X training data set
- **X_test.txt** - X test data set
- **y_train.txt** - y training data set
- **y_test.txt** - y test data set
- **subject_train.txt** - subject training data set
- **subject_test.txt** - subject test data set
- **CourseProjectTidy.txt** - output file of run_analysis.txt; includes mean and standard deviation of each measurement broken down by “subject_id” and “activity_name”
